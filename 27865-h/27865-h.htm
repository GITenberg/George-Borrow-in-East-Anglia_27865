7</span>CHAPTER I: EAST ANGLIA</h2>
<p>It is a trite saying, the truth of which is so universally
admitted that it is hardly worth repeating, that a man&rsquo;s
memory, above all things, retains most vividly recollections of
the scenes amidst which he passed his early days.&nbsp; Amidst
the loneliness of the African veldt or American prairie
solitudes, the West-countryman dreams of Devon&rsquo;s grassy
tors and honeysuckle lanes, and Cornish headlands, fretted by the
foaming waves of the grey Atlantic; in teaming cities, where the
pulse of life beats loud and strong, the Scotsman ever cherishes
sweet, sad thoughts of the braes and burns about his Highland
home; between the close-packed roofs of a London alley, the
Italian immigrant sees the sunny skies and deep blue seas of his
native land, the German pictures to himself the loveliness of the
legend-haunted Rhineland, and the Scandinavian, closing his eyes
and ears to the squalor and misery, <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>wonders whether
the sea-birds still circle above the stone-built cottage in the
Nordland cleft, and cry weirdly from the darkness as they sweep
landward in the night.&nbsp; Many a wanderer, whatever else he
may let go, holds in his heart the hope that one day he may go
back to the place where his boyhood&rsquo;s days were spent, even
though it be but to dwell alone amidst the phantoms of long dead
dreams and long lost loves.</p>
<p>East Anglia may well be compared to a sad-faced mother, who
sees her children, whom she would fain keep with her, one by one
go out into the wide world to seek those things that cannot be
found in her humble home.&nbsp; For years the youths of Eastern
England have had to leave the hamlet hall, the village rectory,
the marshland farmstead, and the cottage home, and wander far and
wide to gain their daily bread.&nbsp; Toil as they might, farm
and field could give them little for their labour, the
mother-country&rsquo;s breast was dry.&nbsp; And yet they loved
her&mdash;loved her dearly.&nbsp; Deeply and firmly rooted in his
heart is the love of the East Anglian for East Anglia.&nbsp; The
outside world has but recently discovered the charm of the
Broadland: by the dweller there it has been felt since the day
when he first gazed with seeing eyes across its dreamy, silent
solitudes.&nbsp; The secrets of the marshland wastes have been
whispered in his ears by the wind in the willows, and have been
sung to him by the sighing sedge.&nbsp; He knows the bird voices
of reed rond and <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>hover, and has read the lesson of the
day&rsquo;s venture in the brightening sunrise and sunset
glow.&nbsp; Amidst scenes that have little changed since the
Iceni hid in the marshland-bordering woods, and crept out in
their coracles on the rush-fringed meres, he is at home with
Nature, and becomes her friend, her lover.&nbsp; She holds back
no secret from him if he wills that he should learn it; she
charms him with her many moods.&nbsp; Her laughter is the
sunlight, and ere it has died away she has hidden coyly in a veil
of mist; now she is tearful with the raindrops falling on her
changeful face, but the light comes back with the silvery
gleaming of her winding rivers.&nbsp; When her lover leaves her,
and wanders off to wooings far away, she reproaches him by her
silence; and when he has time to think, he remembers with regret
and longing the restful loveliness that was once about him like a
mantle of peace.</p>
<p>Flowering meads, wide-reaching marshland solitudes, lonely
heaths and sandhills sloping downward to the sea;
wildfowl-haunted shores and flats, rivers and lagoons through
which the wherries glide, the calling of the herdman and the
sighing of the sea-wind through bracken, gorse, and fir
ridge&mdash;these are East Anglia, and, like voices heard in
childhood, they are with her children wherever they may wander,
until all earthly voices are for ever lost in silence.</p>
<p>No one felt the charm of peaceful Eastern England more fully
and deeply than did George <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Borrow.&nbsp;
An East Anglian born, he was nurtured within the borders of
Norfolk during many of the most impressionable years of his life,
and when world-worn and weary, he sought rest from his
wanderings, he came back to East Anglia to die.&nbsp; During his
latter days, he became rather inaccessible; but an East
Englishman always had a better chance of successfully approaching
him than any one not so fortunate as to have been born within the
compass of East Anglia.&nbsp; Mr. Theodore Watts discovered this
when Borrow and he were the guests of Dr. Hake at Roehampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I went on to tell him,&rdquo; writes Mr. Watts,
&ldquo;that I once used to drive a genuine Shales mare, a
descendant of that same famous Norfolk trotter who could trot
fabulous miles an hour, to whom he, with the Norfolk farmers,
raised his hat in reverence at the Norwich horse fair; and when I
promised to show him a portrait of this same East Anglian mare
with myself behind her in a dogcart&mdash;an East Anglian
dogcart; when I praised the stinging saltness of the sea-water of
Yarmouth, Lowestoft, and Cromer, the quality of which makes it
the best, the most delightful of all sea-water to swim in; when I
told him that the only English river in which you could see
reflected the rainbow he loved was &lsquo;the glassy Ouse&rsquo;
of East Anglia, and the only place in England where you could see
it reflected in the wet sand was the Norfolk coast; and when I
told him a good many things showing that I was in very truth <!--
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>not only an Englishman but an East Englishman, my
conquest of the &lsquo;walking lord of gipsy lore&rsquo; was
complete, and from that moment we became friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is on sand alone,&rdquo; said Borrow, &ldquo;that
the sea strikes its true music&mdash;Norfolk sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best of the sea&rsquo;s lutes,&rdquo; chimed in the
artful Watts, &ldquo;is made by the sands of Cromer.&rdquo;</p>

12</span>CHAPTER II: EARLY DAYS</h2>
<p>The eighteenth century had almost run its course when the
exigencies of England&rsquo;s conflict with the French brought
Thomas Borrow, a stalwart Cornishman, into East Anglia, on
recruiting service.&nbsp; For several years the worthy
West-countryman had served his king in the rank and file of the
British army before he was appointed sergeant-major of the newly
raised body of West Norfolk Militia.&nbsp; The headquarters of
this regiment was East Dereham, a pleasant little country town
situated about sixteen miles from the Norfolk capital.</p>
<p>Thomas Borrow came of a good Cornish family, and explanation
of his having attained nothing better than non-commissioned rank
is to be found in the fact that he preferred to enter the army as
a private soldier&mdash;some say that he ran away from home in
order to enlist.&nbsp; That his duties as a sergeant-major were
performed in a creditable and satisfactory manner we are
justified in believing, knowing that in 1798 he was raised to the
position of captain and adjutant of the regiment.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>While in Dereham, Sergeant-major Borrow made the
acquaintance of Ann Parfrement, the daughter of a small farmer of
French Huguenot extraction, living at Dumpling Green, an open
neighbourhood in the outskirts of the town.&nbsp; This
acquaintance ripened into a mutual attachment, and on Borrow
receiving promotion the two were united in marriage.&nbsp; Two
children were born to them; the younger of whom, George Henry
Borrow, was born on July 5th, 1803.</p>
<p>The wandering instinct that George afterwards developed may
well have been the natural outcome of the roving life of his
early years.&nbsp; Before he was many months old, his parents,
obedient to the dictates of military command, had moved from
Dereham to Canterbury.&nbsp; The year 1809, however, saw them
back again in the little Norfolk town with which Borrow&rsquo;s
earliest recollections were associated.</p>
<p>East Dereham is a town of Anglo-Saxon foundation, and strange
legends and traditions are interwoven with its history.&nbsp;
To-day it is chiefly known for the fact that the bones of the
poet Cowper rest beneath the chancel of its ancient church.&nbsp;
To this church of St. Nicholas, George was taken by his parents
every Sunday.&nbsp; Writing in after years, he says, &ldquo;Twice
every Sunday I was regularly taken to the church, where, from a
corner of the large spacious pew, lined with black leather, I
would fix my eyes on the dignified High-church rector, and the
dignified High-church clerk, and watch the movement <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of
their lips, from which, as they read their respective portions of
the venerable Liturgy, would roll many a portentous word
descriptive of the wondrous works of the Most High.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vicar of Dereham at this time was the Rev. Charles Hyde
Wollaston.&nbsp; The &ldquo;dignified High-church clerk&rdquo;
was George Philo (spelt Philoh in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;), an old
soldier, retired on a pension.</p>
<p>The Borrows remained in Dereham only a few months, but their
stay in the place was ever after a memorable one in
George&rsquo;s mind, for the occurrence of a great event.&nbsp; A
young lady, a friend of the family, presented him with a copy of
&ldquo;Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo;&nbsp; This book first aroused in
him a desire for knowledge.&nbsp; For hours together he sat
poring over its pages, until, &ldquo;under a shoulder-of-mutton
sail, I found myself cantering before a steady breeze over an
ocean of enchantment, so well pleased with my voyage that I cared
not how long it might be ere it reached its
termination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After settling down for a time at Norman Cross in
Huntingdonshire and in Edinburgh, Captain Borrow retired into
private life; but not for long.&nbsp; Elba failed to hold the
fiery Corsican, Napoleon again burst upon the battlefield of
Europe, the demon of war and ravage was again abroad.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s corps was levied anew, and his eldest son, John,
became one of its officers.&nbsp; Before the regiment saw
service, however, the escaped lion was again caged.&nbsp; But it
was not disbanded, and, being in a thoroughly <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>efficient
state, was ordered to Ireland, where local trouble was
feared.&nbsp; The autumn of 1815 saw the Borrows sail from
Harwich.&nbsp; After a voyage of eight days, during which a
terrific storm was encountered and the transports nearly
foundered, the military force of eight hundred men was landed on
the Irish coast.&nbsp; After a lengthy stay at Clonmel, where, as
in Edinburgh, George was sent to school, the corps moved their
quarters to Templemore.</p>
<p>During the following year, Captain Borrow returned to Norfolk,
and settled down with his family in a small house which is still
standing in Willow Lane, Norwich.&nbsp; George was at once
entered as a pupil at King Edward&rsquo;s Grammar School, then
conducted by Dr. Valpy, and remained a scholar there till 1818,
when he attained his fifteenth year.&nbsp; As a schoolboy he
appears to have been an apter pupil of Defoe than of the reverend
headmaster of the Norwich academy.&nbsp; Dr. James Martineau, who
was one of his schoolfellows, has related how Borrow once
persuaded several of his companions to rob their father&rsquo;s
tills, and run away to join the smugglers of the East Anglian
coast.&nbsp; For this escapade he was awarded due punishment,
which he received hoisted on the back of the future celebrated
Unitarian divine.&nbsp; Miss Frances Cobbe, who knew both Borrow
and Dr. Martineau in after years, says in her Autobiography,
&ldquo;The early connection between the two old men as I knew
them was irresistibly comic to my mind.&nbsp; When I asked Mr.
Borrow once to come and<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>meet some friends at our house, he
accepted our invitation as usual, but, on finding that Dr.
Martineau was to be of the party, hastily withdrew his acceptance
on a transparent excuse, nor did he ever after attend our little
assemblies without first ascertaining that Dr. Martineau would
not be present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion, George&mdash;probably in emulation of the
East Anglian Iceni&mdash;dyed his face with walnut juice, causing
Dr. Valpy to inquire whether he was &ldquo;suffering from
jaundice, or if it was only dirt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Jessop, who
was afterwards headmaster of the school, says that there was a
tradition that Borrow was indolent and even stupid.&nbsp; There
is little doubt that he was a dreamy youth, much given to
introspective thought and wild imaginings; but, in spite of these
drawbacks in the dominie&rsquo;s eyes, he was a very human boy,
fond of outdoor life and sports.&nbsp; Some of his pursuits,
however&mdash;such as his liking for philological studies, and
for the company of gipsies and horsey men generally&mdash;might
well trouble his father, who was a steady-going old gentleman of
strictly conventional methods and ideas.&nbsp; George stood in
considerable awe of him, and always felt ill at ease in his
presence.&nbsp; No doubt the old soldier frequently remonstrated
with him for his indulgence in idle pleasures and lax ideas of
duty.&nbsp; As a lad, he probably found it hard to justify
himself in his father&rsquo;s eyes, but there is a passage in
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; written five-and-twenty years later,
which clearly expresses his views:</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;I have heard talk of the pleasures of idleness,
yet it is my own firm belief that no one ever yet took pleasure
in it.&nbsp; Mere idleness is the most disagreeable state of
existence, and both mind and body are continually making efforts
to escape from it.&nbsp; It has been said that idleness is the
parent of mischief, which is very true; but mischief itself is
merely an attempt to escape from the dreary vacuum of
idleness.&nbsp; There are many tasks and occupations which a man
is unwilling to perform, but let no one think that he is
therefore in love with idleness; he turns to something which is
more agreeable to his inclination, and doubtless more suited to
his nature, but he is not in love with idleness.&nbsp; A boy may
play the truant from school because he dislikes his books and
study; but, depend upon it, he intends doing something the
while&mdash;to go fishing, or perhaps to take a walk; and who
knows but that from such excursions both his mind and body may
derive more benefit than from books and school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contemporary with Borrow at Norwich Grammar School were
several lads whose names were afterwards written in large and
shining letters on the scroll of fame.&nbsp; Amongst these were
James Brooke, the Rajah of Sarawak, Sir Archdale Wilson, and, as
has already been said, Dr. James Martineau.&nbsp; The old city
has always borne itself with dignity during the passage of events
that have gone to make up its history, as though conscious of its
ability to send <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>forth into the world sons who would
do honour to her record and old foundations and traditions.&nbsp;
From that old school they have gone out into every walk of life,
carrying with them over land and sea, into court and pulpit, to
bench and bar, hallowed memories of days spent within its
walls.&nbsp; Not ten years before Borrow&rsquo;s name was entered
on its roll, its most brilliant star had set at Trafalgar, where
Nelson found amidst the hailing death that poured upon the decks
of the battered <i>Victory</i> the passport to immortal fame and
glory.</p>
<h2><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>CHAPTER III: THE LAWYER&rsquo;S CLERK</h2>
<p>When, at the end of his fifteenth year, George Borrow
completed his term of study at the Norwich Grammar School, his
parents had considerable difficulty in determining upon a
profession for their erratic son.&nbsp; In the solution of this
problem he, himself, could help them but little towards a
satisfactory conclusion.&nbsp; His strange disposition and tastes
were a source of continual astonishment and mystification to the
old people.&nbsp; What, they asked themselves, could be done with
a lad whose only decided bent was in the direction of
philological studies, who at an early age had attained a
knowledge of Erse, and whose great pleasure it was to converse in
Romany with the gipsies whom he met at the fair-ground on Norwich
Castle Hill?&nbsp; His father was anxious that he should enter
the Church; but George&rsquo;s unsettled disposition was an
effectual bar against his taking such a step, for he would never
have been able to apply himself with sufficient attention to the
necessary routine course of college study.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>In the midst of the warm controversy that the question
excited he fell ill, and firmly believed that he was going to
die.&nbsp; His near approach to dissolution found him quite
resigned.&nbsp; A listless willingness to let life go, grew upon
him during the dreary days of helpless inactivity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Death,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;appeared to him little else
than a pleasant sleep, and he wished for sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
a long life was before him, and, after spending weeks upon his
bed, his strength came back to him, and with it the still
unsolved problem of a suitable vocation.&nbsp; It was at last
decided that he should enter upon a legal career.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that the legal profession was one for
which Borrow was the least adapted, and of this he was well
aware.&nbsp; When, however, in 1819, the time arrived for him to
be articled to Messrs. Simpson and Rackham of Tuck&rsquo;s Court,
St. Giles, he apparently offered no objection, and his
recollections of the years when he was tied to a lawyer&rsquo;s
desk were always pleasant to him in after-life.</p>
<p>But these pleasant recollections had little to do with the
duties of his calling&mdash;they arose rather from the fact that
his work was easy, and so intermittent as to give him ample
opportunity for indulging in his day-dreams.&nbsp; Who can doubt
the personal basis of that passage in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; in
which he says: &ldquo;Yes, very pleasant times were those, when
within the womb of a lofty desk, behind which I sat for some
hours every day, transcribing (when I imagined eyes were upon me)
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>documents of every description in every possible
hand.&nbsp; Blackstone kept company with Ab Gwilym&mdash;the
polished English lawyer of the last century, who wrote long and
prosy chapters on the rights of things&mdash;with a certain wild
Welshman, who some four hundred years before that time indited
immortal cowydds or odes to the wives of Cambrian
chieftains&mdash;more particularly to one Morfydd, the wife of a
certain hunch-backed dignitary called by the poet facetiously Bwa
Bach&mdash;generally terminating with the modest request of a
little private parlance beneath the greenwood bough, with no
other witness than the eos, or nightingale; a request which, if
the poet may be believed, rather a doubtful point, was seldom,
very seldom, denied.&nbsp; And by what strange chance had Gwilym
and Blackstone, two personages so exceedingly different, been
thus brought together?&nbsp; From what the reader already knows
of me, he may be quite prepared to find me reading the former;
but what could have induced me to take up Blackstone, or rather
law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, there was little in Borrow&rsquo;s nature that was in
common with that of the followers of the legal profession.&nbsp;
What food for his wild imagination could he find in the prosy
records and dry-as-dust documents of a lawyer&rsquo;s
office?&nbsp; They contained words that to him, as to many of his
master&rsquo;s clients, were without meaning: his thoughts
wandered beyond their mazy entanglements into a realm where the
law that restrained was that of Nature <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>alone, and
whose only order was planned by the spirit that sent forth
shadows and dreams.&nbsp; He had been too much of a rover, had
seen too many strange sights in his young life, to be able to
satisfy his cravings for knowledge in musty law tomes and dusty
deeds.&nbsp; His curiosity had been aroused by many things he had
seen in his early travels, he had had glimpses into so many wide
fields of interest that led his mind astray.&nbsp; But none of
these seemed to the steady-going old Militia captain to show a
practical opening for his second son, whom, therefore, we find
copying legal documents in a &ldquo;strange old house occupying
one side of a long and narrow court,&rdquo; instead of going
a-viking with the Norseman or roving with the wild Welsh
bard.</p>
<p>Borrow has left us a striking picture of the head of the firm
of Simpson and Rackham; a picture drawn with that wealth of
detail and uncompromising truthfulness which would have made the
worthy gentleman tremble had he known at the time what a keen
observer he was receiving beneath his roof.&nbsp; &ldquo;A more
respectable-looking individual was never seen,&rdquo; writes his
erstwhile pupil; &ldquo;he really looked what he was, a gentleman
of the law&mdash;there was nothing of the pettifogger about him:
somewhat under middle size, and somewhat rotund in person, he was
always dressed in a full suit of black, never worn long enough to
become threadbare.&nbsp; His face was rubicund, and not without
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>keenness; but the most remarkable thing about him was
his head, which was bald, and shone like polished ivory, nothing
more white, smooth and lustrous.&nbsp; Some people have said that
he wore false calves, probably because his black silk stockings
never exhibited a wrinkle; they might as well have said that he
waddled because his shoes creaked, for these last, which were
always without a speck, and polished as his crown, though of a
different hue, did creak, as he walked rather slowly.&nbsp; I
cannot say that I ever saw him walk fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then follows a little glimpse into the provincial life of
the old Norfolk capital that shows how little change there has
been in the aims and habits of a certain portion of the middle
class since the first quarter of the century.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had
a handsome practice, and might have died a very rich man, much
richer than he did, had he not been in the habit of giving rather
expensive dinners to certain great people, who gave him nothing
in return, except their company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This worthy old gentleman must have been sorely puzzled as to
what he should make of the tall, spare, serious-looking lad who
was placed under his charge.&nbsp; He confessed to the old
captain that the latter&rsquo;s son was &ldquo;a very
extraordinary youth, a most remarkable youth, indeed;&rdquo; and
we can well believe him.&nbsp; On one occasion, Borrow showed a
one-eyed beggar into his master&rsquo;s private room, and
installed him in an armchair &ldquo;like a justice of the <!--
page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time, when invited to Mr.
Simpson&rsquo;s house, he electrified a learned archdeacon and
the company generally by maintaining that his favourite Ab Gwilym
was a better poet than Ovid, and that many of the classic writers
were greatly over-valued.&nbsp; Borrow often distinguished
himself later on by his blunt way of expressing his opinions, and
the habit seems to have grown upon him early in life.</p>
<p>A sense of duty towards those who were responsible for his
upbringing, does not seem to have been a strong point with George
Borrow.&nbsp; He disliked the profession to which he was
apprenticed, and it is evident that his mind was as absent from
his duties as was his heart.&nbsp; He was always dreaming of
sagas and sea-rovers, battles and bards.&nbsp; Shut up in his
dull and dusty desk, he would</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;catch
in sudden gleams<br />
The sheen of the far-surrounding seas,<br />
And islands that were the Hesperides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all (his) boyish dreams.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one will deny that &ldquo;the thoughts of youth are long,
long thoughts,&rdquo; for have we not all thought such thoughts,
and dreamt our dreams?&nbsp; But they are not as a rule conducive
to the attainment of a mastery of the details and subtleties of
law.</p>
<p>One day an old countryman from the coast brought George a book
of Danish ballads, left at his coast-line cottage by a crew of
shipwrecked Danes.&nbsp; Once possessed of this work, he could
not <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>rest satisfied until he had mastered the Danish language
in order that he might unearth its historical and legendary
treasures.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Danes, the Danes!&rdquo; he exclaims
to himself, as he holds the priceless volume in his hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And was I at last to become acquainted, and in so singular
a manner, with the speech of a people which had, as far back as I
could remember, exercised the strongest influence over my
imagination.&nbsp; For the book was a book of ballads, about the
deeds of knights and champions, and men of huge stature; ballads
which from time immemorial had been sung in the North, and which
some two centuries before the time of which I am speaking, had
been collected by one Anders Vedel, who lived with a certain
Tycho Brahe, and assisted him in making observations upon the
heavenly bodies, at a place called Uranias Castle on the little
island of Hveen, in the Cattegat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, Borrow was never meant to be a lawyer; but no calling that
was possible to him could have suited him so well at the time
with which we are dealing.&nbsp; Apparently the tasks set him
were so light that he had ample opportunity for the pursuance of
the philological investigations that he delighted in.&nbsp; His
efforts in this direction attracted the attention of Dr. William
Taylor, who had returned to his native city after his wanderings
in France and Germany.&nbsp; As is well known, the accomplished
scholar and translator was an intimate friend of Southey&rsquo;s,
and it was to the poet he <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>wrote:
&ldquo;A Norwich young man is construing with me Schiller&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Wilhelm Tell,&rsquo; with the view of translating it for
the press.&nbsp; His name is George Henry Borrow, and he has
learnt German with extraordinary rapidity; indeed, he has the
gift of tongues, and though not yet eighteen understands twelve
languages&mdash;English, Welsh, Erse, Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
German, Danish, French, Italian, Spanish, and
Portuguese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Describing Taylor, when he and Lavengro are discussing
together the possibility of becoming a good German scholar
without being an ardent smoker, Borrow writes: &ldquo;The
forehead of the elder individual was high, and perhaps appeared
more so than it really was, from the hair being carefully brushed
back, as if for the purpose of displaying to the best advantage
that part of the cranium; his eyes were large and full, and of a
light brown, and might have been called heavy and dull, had they
not been occasionally lighted up by a sudden gleam not so
brilliant, however, as that which at every inhalation shone from
the bowl of a long clay pipe which he was smoking, but which,
from a certain sucking sound which about this time began to be
heard from the bottom, appeared to be giving notice that it would
soon require replenishment from a certain canister which,
together with a lighted taper, stood upon the table beside
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the elderly German student and his youthful emulator were
kindred spirits, there is no doubt; and <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Taylor seems
to have instilled into Borrow&rsquo;s mind many of his own tastes
and admirations.&nbsp; Amongst these was a sincere admiration for
Southey, whom Borrow, with his love of superlatives, looked upon
not so much as a poet as England&rsquo;s best prose writer, and
probably the purest and most noble character to which she had
ever given birth.</p>
<p>We have no sure knowledge of whether, while in Norwich, Borrow
made the acquaintance of Old Crome.&nbsp; We know, however, that
he was an enthusiastic admirer of the self-taught master of the
Old Norwich School of artists.&nbsp; Still, he may never have
been brought into immediate contact with him; for Crome was in
his forty-sixth year when Borrow&rsquo;s family first appeared in
Norwich, and George was then but a young lad.&nbsp; But before
1821, when Old Crome died, Borrow must have learnt a good deal
both of the painter and his pictures, for the admiration that he
afterwards expressed can hardly have been entirely the outcome of
the artist&rsquo;s posthumous fame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has painted,&rdquo; writes Borrow, &ldquo;not
pictures of the world, but English pictures, such as Gainsborough
himself might have done; beautiful rural pieces, with trees that
might well tempt the little birds to perch upon them; thou
needest not run to Rome, brother&rdquo; (this was written of the
time when his brother John was leaving England to study art upon
the Continent), &ldquo;where lives the old Mariolater, after
pictures of the world, whilst at home there are <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>pictures of
England; nor needest thou even go to London, the big city, in
search of a master, for thou hast one at home in the old East
Anglian town, who can instruct thee, while thou needest
instruction; better stay at home, brother, at least for a season,
and toil and strive &rsquo;midst groanings and despondency till
thou hast attained excellence, even as he has done&mdash;the
little dark man with the dark-brown coat and the top-boots, whose
name will one day be considered the chief ornament of the old
town, and whose works will at no distant period rank amongst the
proudest pictures of England&mdash;and England against the
world!&mdash;thy master, my brother, all too little considered
master&mdash;Crome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would almost appear from the details of the dark-brown coat
and top-boots that Borrow must have met Crome at some period of
his Norwich life.&nbsp; From the foregoing eulogy, one would
gather that his brother John was a pupil of the old
painter.&nbsp; This may well have been the case, for Crome had
many such pupils, amongst whom, as has lately been shown, were,
in earlier years, some of the sisters Gurney of Earlham.</p>

29</span>CHAPTER IV: DAYS IN NORWICH</h2>
<p>The Norwich of Borrow&rsquo;s early years was noted for its
literary and artistic associations, and the names of some of its
more distinguished writers and painters were household words in
the land.&nbsp; Harriet Martineau had &ldquo;left off darning
stockings to take to literature&rdquo;; Dr. Taylor was opening up
to English readers a new field in German writings; John Sell
Cotman was making a name for himself; and Opie, who &ldquo;lived
to paint,&rdquo; was often seen at Earlham, Keswick, and in the
city streets.&nbsp; Such names as these, and of Elizabeth Fry,
Sir James Smith (who founded the Linn&aelig;an Society), and Mrs.
Opie would fall upon the ear of the young lawyer&rsquo;s clerk
whenever he mixed in polite society.&nbsp; The old city was then
enjoying a reputation that was worthy of its best traditions; and
it still prides itself on the memory of those golden days.</p>
<p>A bookish youth could not fail to be influenced by such
associations, and it may well be that Borrow&rsquo;s thoughts
were first drawn into a literary groove by a knowledge of what
certain of these Norwich celebrities <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>were
doing.&nbsp; The delight he had found in the pages of his book of
Danish ballads, inspired him to turn his pen from the copying of
deeds to the writing of verses.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Romantic Ballads
from the Danish,&rdquo; printed by Simon Wilkins of Norwich, and
consisting of translations from his prized volume, appeared in
1826.&nbsp; Dr. Jessop surmises that these translations must have
brought him in a very respectable sum, but Mr. Augustus Birrell,
in his own inimitable way, expresses his doubt on the
point.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope it was so,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;but, as Dr. Johnson once said about the immortality of the
soul, I should like more evidence of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s translations and linguistic pursuits, however,
were not allowed to occupy all his spare hours in those early
days.&nbsp; Norwich and its neighbourhood had too much to show
him, and to move him to reflection and enthusiasm, to allow this
to be the case.&nbsp; By degrees, he came to love the old city,
as he never got to love any other place in after-life.&nbsp;
Writing many years later, the memories of it flooded in upon his
brain until he saw its castle and cathedral, its homes and
hospitality, in such a rosy light as never glowed upon the scenes
through which he journeyed in after years.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who can
wonder,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;that the children of that fine old
city are proud of her, and offer up prayers for her
prosperity?&nbsp; I, myself, who was not born within her walls,
offer up prayers for her prosperity, that want may never visit
her cottages, vice her palaces, and <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>that the
abomination of idolatry may never pollute her temples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grey old castle and stately cathedral were a never-failing
source of interest, worship and delight to him, as they have been
to many who cannot claim East Anglia for their homeland.&nbsp;
Often he would lie upon the grass in the sunlight and watch the
rooks and choughs circle about their battlements and
spires.&nbsp; As he said, he was not formed for an indoor
student, and outdoor life had ever a greater charm for him than
the library or the study.&nbsp; Often with rod and gun (he had an
old Tower musket nearly eighty years old) he would go down
amongst the marshes to angle or shoot as the fancy took him and
the season gave him sport.&nbsp; Fortunately, the old
fowling-piece was sound, although condemned on account of its
age, and he never came to harm by it; indeed, if we may believe
him in this matter&mdash;and it is always hard to put implicit
faith in a solitary sportsman or angler&mdash;he did considerable
execution amongst the birds of the Broadland.</p>
<p>Still there were times when even the attraction of the rod and
gun were not sufficient to keep him from dreaming.&nbsp; Then, he
would throw himself down on some mossy bank and let his mind
wander back into the mists and mysteries of the days of
yore.&nbsp; There was one favourite spot of his, where, from
beneath an arch, &ldquo;the waters rush garrulously into a blue
pool, and are there stilled for a time, for the pool is deep, and
they appear to have sunk to <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>sleep.&nbsp;
Further on, however, you hear their voice again, where they
ripple gaily over yon gravelly shallow.&nbsp; On the left, the
hill slopes gently down to the margin of the stream.&nbsp; On the
right is a green level, a smiling meadow; grass of the richest
decks the side of the slope; mighty trees also adorn it, giant
elms, the nearest of which, when the sun is nigh its meridian,
fling a broad shadow on the face of the pool; through yon vista
you catch a glimpse of the ancient brick of an old English
hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; This old hall stood on the site of an older
hearthstead called the Earl&rsquo;s Home, where lived some
&ldquo;Sigurd or Thorkild&rdquo; in the days &ldquo;when Thor and
Freya were yet gods, and Odin was a portentous name.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Earlham stands to-day as it did in Borrow&rsquo;s time, and, no
doubt, other Norwich lads at times lie out on the hillside
dreaming of the sea-rovers of Scandinavia who ravaged the hearths
and homes of the marshland folk of East Anglia.</p>
<p>Amongst the Norwich celebrities whom Borrow met, was Joseph
John Gurney of Earlham, the large-hearted Quaker brother of
Elizabeth Fry.&nbsp; Mr. Gurney seems to have come across him one
day while he was fishing, and to have remonstrated with him for
taking pleasure in such &ldquo;a cruel diversion.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was a tall man, &ldquo;dressed in raiment of a quaint and
singular fashion, but of goodly materials.&nbsp; He was in the
pride and vigour of manhood (Joseph John Gurney was born in
1788); his features handsome and noble, but full of calmness and
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>benevolence; at least I thought so, though they were
somewhat shaded by a hat of finest beaver, with broad drooping
eaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worthy Quaker, whose words had the effect of lessening
Borrow&rsquo;s inclination for angling, invited him to Earlham
that he might search the library there for any such works as
might please and interest him.&nbsp; This was an occupation so
much to Borrow&rsquo;s taste, that we wonder he did not accept
the invitation.&nbsp; He did not do so, however, but sought out
far different companions&mdash;namely, the Romanies whom he met
at Tombland Fair and on Mousehold Heath.&nbsp; It was many years
after that he paid his first visit to Earlham.&nbsp; Gurney did
not then remember him as the youth whom he had met by the side of
the marshland stream; but he took him to the library, and showed
him the books of which he had spoken many years before.&nbsp; One
of them was the work of a moneychanger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a
banker myself,&rdquo; said Gurney, and the fact seems to have
been the cause of reproachings on the part of some of the Norwich
&ldquo;Friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; A letter of his appears in the
chronicles of &ldquo;The Gurneys of Earlham,&rdquo; in which he
writes: &ldquo;I suppose my leading object in life may be said to
be the bank.&nbsp; It sometimes startles me to find my leading
object of such a nature, and now and then I doubt whether it is
quite consistent with my religious pursuits and
duties.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eventually he arrives at the conclusion
that: &ldquo;While I am a banker, the bank <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>must be
attended to.&nbsp; It is obviously the religious duty of a
trustee to so large an amount to be diligent in watching his
trust.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow, with whom he discussed the matter,
sums up the case by exclaiming, &ldquo;Would that there were many
like him, amidst the money-changers of princes!&nbsp; The hall of
many an earl lacks the bounty, the palace of many a prelate the
piety and learning, which adorn the quiet Quaker&rsquo;s
home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was the death of his father that brought about the first
severing of Borrow&rsquo;s connection with Norwich.&nbsp; Captain
Borrow, as his portrait shows and his son declares, had been a
sturdy soldier, possessing great physical strength.&nbsp; He
enjoyed several years of quiet domestic life before the end came,
and lingered for some months after the fatal illness seized
him.&nbsp; At times he would rally, so that he could walk abroad
a little, or sit up in the small parlour of the house in Willow
Lane, wearing an old regimental coat, and with his dog at his
feet.&nbsp; He used to have long talks with George on such
occasions, and would relate to him stories of his past life, and
the distinguished people he had met.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had
frequently conversed&mdash;almost on terms of
familiarity&mdash;with good old George.&nbsp; He had known the
conqueror of Tippoo Saib: and was the friend of Townshend, who,
when Wolfe fell, led the British Grenadiers against the shrinking
regiments of Montcalm.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>The old veteran&rsquo;s elder son, John, who was absent
from England, hastened home just in time to receive his
father&rsquo;s blessing.&nbsp; In the middle of the night, a
sudden relapse brought the dying man&rsquo;s wife and sons to his
bedside.&nbsp; In his last moments, his mind wandered and he
spoke of &ldquo;Minden, and of Meredith, the old Minden
sergeant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Last of all, &ldquo;he uttered another
name clearly, distinctly, and it was the name of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With that name upon his lips,&rdquo;
writes George Borrow, &ldquo;the brave old soldier sank back upon
my bosom, and, with his hands still clasped, yielded up his
soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; His death took place on February 28, 1824, and
he was buried in the churchyard of St. Giles, at Norwich.</p>
<p>The two brothers remained at home with their mother for some
time after their father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; John fitted up a
studio in the little house in Willow Lane, and there devoted
himself to his art.&nbsp; His work does not seem to have been
very remunerative, and eventually he went abroad in connection
with a mining venture, and died in Mexico in 1833.&nbsp; George
had a great opinion of his brother&rsquo;s painting, and believed
that if he had lived and continued to strive after excellence he
would have left &ldquo;some enduring monument of his
powers&rdquo;; but his estimate of John&rsquo;s endowments may
have been biassed by his affection.&nbsp; His love for his
brother was deep and abiding, and was not lessened by his
father&rsquo;s marked preference for his elder son.</p>
<p>The precise date of Borrow&rsquo;s leaving Norwich <!-- page
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>and
betaking himself to London cannot be ascertained, but it is
certain that he left his brother behind him in the old
home.&nbsp; Mr. Birrell believes it to have been not later than
1828, and says &ldquo;his only introduction appears to have been
one from William Taylor to Sir Richard Phillips, the publisher
known to all readers of &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. George
Saintsbury sums up his life in Norwich with the remark that
&ldquo;he occupied his time with things that obviously would not
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A friend of the writer, who recently examined the old house in
Willow Lane, has contributed the following description of its
appearance at the time of his visit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a quiet, secluded court, opening from a narrow lane
in the old city of Norwich, stands an unpretentious house, which
at first sight presents little to attract the attention of a
visitor.&nbsp; A closer inspection, however, discloses a marble
slab affixed over the door, bearing the following inscription:
&lsquo;In this house resided for some years of the earlier
portion of his life, George Henry Borrow, author of &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain&rdquo;; and other valued works.&nbsp; Died in
1881, aged 78 years.&rsquo;&nbsp; The old house immediately
becomes invested with great interest to one who has spent many
enraptured hours over the pages of the writer whose association
with Norwich has been thus commemorated by Sir Peter Eade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house itself is of somewhat ancient date, <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and
its external appearance affords little indication of its size and
the comfort of its arrangement within.&nbsp; Its condition is
practically unchanged since the time when it was inhabited by the
Borrow family.&nbsp; The present proprietor, Mr. W. Cooper, with
a commendable respect for the memory of the great author, has
made but few alterations.&nbsp; The principal change that has
been effected is in the division of the house into two separate
parts.&nbsp; This has been easily accomplished by the simple
process of blocking up a door in the hall, and forming another
doorway in the front of the house.&nbsp; The peculiar plan of the
building adapts itself to this arrangement, no other alteration
being found necessary for the complete disconnection of the two
parts.&nbsp; Of the two cottages so formed, one is at present
occupied by an old couple, while the other is used as a
workshop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On entering the front door, which has a picturesque,
antique porchway, access is gained to a fairly spacious hall,
paved with tiles, from which ascends the main staircase of fine
old oak.&nbsp; The door that is now closed, opened into a
commodious front room, with a large window facing the west.&nbsp;
This contains some finely carved panelling in a good state of
preservation, and was evidently the chief room of the
house.&nbsp; From it a passage extends to the back
buildings.&nbsp; A narrow and particularly tortuous staircase
leads from the front room to the upper rooms at the back of the
house, to which <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>access cannot be gained by the main
stairs.&nbsp; On passing through the hall, the visitor finds
himself in a large kitchen, where provision is made for an
exceptionally big fireplace.&nbsp; In common with most old
houses, every inch of available space is converted into
cupboards, which are to be discovered in most unexpected nooks
and corners.&nbsp; All the rooms are panelled, but it is only the
large rooms just mentioned that contain any carving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the first floor, the arrangements are of a similar
nature to those on the ground floor.&nbsp; From the landing of
the main staircase open two rooms, a large one over the best
room, and a smaller one above the hall.&nbsp; In the
first-mentioned is a noticeable fireplace, which, in the place of
the customary mantelpiece, has a panel-work frame, uniform with
that surrounding the other rooms.&nbsp; The place of the centre
panel was formerly occupied by a large oil painting, which
remained in its position for some time after the Borrows vacated
the house, and is now in the possession of Mr. Cooper.&nbsp; It
represents &lsquo;The Judgment of Solomon,&rsquo; and is supposed
to be the work of John Borrow, George&rsquo;s artist
brother.&nbsp; The two remaining bedrooms, which are reached by
the small staircase, are of unequal size on account of a narrow
passage, from which rises a short flight of stairs leading to a
very irregular-shaped attic in the roof.&rdquo;</p>

39</span>CHAPTER V: LIFE AT OULTON</h2>
<p>After many painful experiences in London, whither he went in
the hope of being able to gain a livelihood by devoting himself
to literature, George Borrow turned his back upon the metropolis,
and set out on that wild, rambling excursion narrated and
enlarged upon in the pages of &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lapse
of time has emphasised the impossibility of ascertaining how much
is fact and how much fiction in the fascinating account of his
wanderings.&nbsp; Criticism on that point is unjustifiable, for
Borrow announced that the book was &ldquo;a dream,&rdquo; and a
history only up to a certain point.&nbsp; From what the writer
has gathered, however, from those who knew Borrow intimately, he
has good reason to believe that there are more facts recorded in
the latter part of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and in &ldquo;The
Romany Rye,&rdquo; than are credited by many students of
&ldquo;Don Jorge&rsquo;s&rdquo; writings.</p>
<p>After lengthy roamings far and wide, he returned again to
Norwich, where he lived for a time a quiet life, of which he has
left no record.&nbsp; His literary exploits had not been of such
a nature as to rank <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>his name with those of the known
writers of his day; indeed, there is every reason for believing
that as an author he was as little known as on the day when he
abandoned the quiet little house in Willow Lane for a wider field
of life.&nbsp; Yet, painful, and even heartbreaking, as his
experiences had been, he was infinitely the gainer by the hard
fate that sent him out a wanderer upon the face of the earth, and
we who read his books to-day may be thankful for the tears and
toilings that brought about so rich and abundant a harvest.</p>
<p>An introduction from Joseph John Gurney to the British and
Foreign Bible Society resulted in Borrow&rsquo;s leaving England
in 1830 for the Continent, where he went on another
<i>wanderjahre</i> not unlike that he had taken in his native
land.</p>
<p>After visiting France, Austria and Italy, we eventually find
him in St. Petersburg, where he undertook the translation of the
Bible into the Mandschu-Tartar language, and issued in 1835,
through Schulz and Beneze, his &ldquo;Targum; or Metrical
Translations from Thirty Languages and Dialects.&rdquo;&nbsp;
While in Russia, he made many friends amongst the nobility there,
who frequently invited him to their country homes.&nbsp; In the
same year that saw the publication of &ldquo;Targum,&rdquo; he
returned home.&nbsp; His stay in England, however, was a very
short one.&nbsp; The British and Foreign Bible Society was so
satisfied with his work in Russia that they pressed him to
continue to serve them, and undertake a journey into Spain for
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>the purpose of circulating the Scriptures in that
country.&nbsp; His travels in Spain occupied over four
years.&nbsp; While there he met Mrs. Mary Clarke, who afterwards
became his wife.&nbsp; This lady, who was the widow of a naval
officer, was connected with a Suffolk family which had been
associated with the village of Oulton for several
generations.&nbsp; Their name was Skeppar, and it was in their
old Suffolk home by the side of Oulton Broad that Borrow went to
live on his return to England.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Borrow, who was now in his thirty-eighth year, set to work at
Oulton upon his &ldquo;Bible in Spain,&rdquo; which was published
by Mr. John Murray, three years later, in 1843.&nbsp; Of his
method, or lack of method, in working, something may be gathered
from the preface to the second edition of &ldquo;The
Zincali,&rdquo; which was written about the time of the issue of
the former book.&nbsp; Mr. Murray had advised him to try his hand
at something different from his &ldquo;sorry trash&rdquo; <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> about gipsies, and write a work that
would really be of credit to the great firm in Albemarle
Street.&nbsp; Borrow responded by starting on an account of his
wanderings in Spain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first I proceeded slowly&mdash;sickness was in the
land, and the face of Nature was overcast&mdash;heavy rainclouds
swam in the heavens, the blast howled amid the pines which nearly
surround my lonely <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>dwelling, and the waters of the lake,
which lies before it, so quiet in general and tranquil, were
fearfully agitated . . . A dreary summer and autumn passed by,
and were succeeded by as gloomy a winter.&nbsp; I still proceeded
with the Bible in Spain.&nbsp; The winter passed, and spring
came, with cold dry winds and occasional sunshine, whereupon I
arose, shouted, and mounting my horse, even Sidi Habismilk, I
scoured all the surrounding district, and thought but little of
the Bible in Spain.&nbsp; So I rode about the country, over the
heaths, and through the green lanes of my native land,
occasionally visiting friends at a distance, and sometimes, for
variety&rsquo;s sake, I stayed at home and amused myself by
catching huge pike, which lie perdue in certain deep ponds
skirted with lofty reeds, upon my land, and to which there is a
communication from the lagoon by a deep and narrow
watercourse.&nbsp; I had almost forgotten the Bible in
Spain.&nbsp; Then came the summer with much heat and sunshine,
and then I would lie for hours in the sun and recall the sunny
days I had spent in Andalusia, and my thoughts were continually
reverting to Spain, and at last I remembered that the Bible in
Spain was still unfinished; whereupon I arose and said:
&lsquo;This loitering profiteth nothing,&rsquo; and I hastened to
my summer-house by the side or the lake, and there I thought and
wrote, and thought and wrote, until I had finished the
&lsquo;Bible in Spain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few weeks of the publication of the &ldquo;Bible in
Spain,&rdquo; Borrow&rsquo;s name was in everyone&rsquo;s <!--
page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>mouth.&nbsp; Attempts were made to &ldquo;lionise&rdquo;
him; but were met with his distinct disapproval, though it was
always a pleasure to him to be looked upon as a celebrity.&nbsp;
To escape from the Mrs. Leo Hunters of fashionable society, he
almost immediately fled to the Continent, where he went on
another pilgrimage.&nbsp; Having journeyed through Turkey,
Albania, Hungary, and Wallachia, he again came home to Oulton,
and completed &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; which had been commenced
almost as soon as the manuscript of &ldquo;The Bible in
Spain&rdquo; had left his hands.&nbsp; This book was finished in
the summer-house of his garden by the broad where most of his
future work was done, and was issued in 1851.</p>
<p>Defending himself against the critics who attacked him for
intermingling truth and fiction in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; he
afterwards wrote: &ldquo;In the preface &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; is
stated to be a dream; and the writer takes this opportunity of
stating that he never said it was an autobiography; never
authorised any person to say that it was one; and that he has in
innumerable instances declared in public and in private, both
before and after the work was published, that it was not what is
generally termed an autobiography: but a set of people who
pretend to write criticisms on books, hating the author for
various reasons, amongst others, because, having the proper pride
of a gentleman and a scholar, he did not in the year 1843, choose
to permit himself to be exhibited and made a zany of in London,
and especially because <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>he will neither associate with, nor
curry favour with, them who are neither gentlemen nor
scholars&mdash;attack his book with abuse and calumny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interrogated by Mr. Theodore Watts as to the real nature of an
autobiography, Borrow asked the question, &ldquo;What is an
autobiography?&nbsp; Is it a mere record of the incidents of a
man&rsquo;s life? or is it a picture of the man himself&mdash;his
character, his soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, Mr. Watts thinks, was a very suggestive query of
Borrow&rsquo;s with regard to himself and his work.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That he sat down to write his own life in
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; I know.&nbsp; He had no idea then of
departing from the strict line of fact.&nbsp; Indeed, his letters
to his friend, Mr. John Murray, would alone be sufficient to
establish this in spite of his calling &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; a
dream.&nbsp; In the first volume he did almost confine himself to
matters of fact.&nbsp; But as he went on he clearly found that
the ordinary tapestry into which Destiny had woven the incidents
of his life were not tinged with sufficient depth of colour to
satisfy his sense of wonder. . . .&nbsp; When he wishes to dive
very boldly into the &lsquo;abysmal deeps of personality,&rsquo;
he speaks and moves partly behind the mask of some fictitious
character . . . Let it be remembered that it was this instinct of
wonder, not the instinct of the mere <i>poseur</i>, that impelled
him to make certain exaggerated statements about the characters
themselves that are introduced into his books.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>The village of Oulton lies on the border of the
marshland about a mile from the most easterly point of England,
and within hearing of the beating of the billows of the wild
North Sea.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s home, which was little more than
a cottage, stood on the side of a slight rising bank overlooking
Oulton Broad, and was sheltered from the winds of the sea and
marshland by a belt of storm-rent pines.&nbsp; The house
contained a sitting-room on either side of the entrance-hall, a
kitchen, four bedrooms, and two attics.&nbsp; It was its
smallness and compactness that commended it to Borrow, and it
also had the extra recommendation to a man of his disposition of
being quiet and secluded.&nbsp; Indeed, so out-of-the-way was its
situation that to take a boat upon the broad was looked upon as
the best and most direct means of attaining this isolated nook of
the Broadland.</p>
<p>At the present time the broad, that stretches away from Lake
Lothing to the westward of Borrow&rsquo;s Ham, <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> is for several months of the year
picturesque with the white sails of yachts and other pleasure
boats that have skimmed its placid waters since the Broadland
first became a holiday resort.&nbsp; In the early days of
Borrow&rsquo;s residence at Oulton, the only craft that stirred
its sunlit ripples were the punts of the eel-catcher and
wildfowl-seeker and the slowly gliding wherries voyaging to and
from the <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>coast and inland towns.&nbsp; To-day,
a little colony of dwellers in red-brick villas have invaded the
lonely spot where Borrow lived; but even now you have but to turn
aside a few steps from the lake side to reach the edge of
far-stretching marshland levels that have changed their face but
little during the passage of many centuries.&nbsp; Farther away
the marshlanders have seized upon any slight piece of rising
ground to establish a firm foundation for their humble homes;
here and there a grey church tower or skeleton windmill breaks
the line of the level horizon.&nbsp; The meres and marshes have
the silence of long dead years resting upon them, save where the
breeze stirs the riverside reeds or a curlew cries above the ooze
flats.</p>
<p>Queer company the &ldquo;walking lord of gipsy lore&rdquo;
must have kept as he sat alone in that little book-lined
summer-house, hearing strange voices in the sighing of the wind
through the fir-trees and the distant sobbing of the sea.&nbsp;
Out of the shadow of the past there would come to him, not only
the swarthy Romanies, but Francis Ardrey, the friend of his
youth; the Armenian merchant, with whom Lavengro discussed Haik;
the victim of the evil chance, who talked nonsense about the
<i>star</i> Jupiter and told him that &ldquo;touching&rdquo;
story of his fight against destiny; the Rev. Mr. Platitude, who
would neither admit there were any Dissenters nor permit any to
exist; Peter Williams, the man who committed the unpardonable sin
against the Holy Ghost, and Winifred, his patient, constant wife;
the student <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>of Chinese, who learnt the language
of the land of the Celestials from the figures on the teapots;
the Hungarian, who related so many legends and traditions of the
Magyars; and Murtagh, with his wonderful stories of the
Pope.&nbsp; These were the friends with whom he spent the real
life of his latter days, and it is hardly surprising that under
the influence of their companionship he should have become
somewhat of a recluse, and lost touch with living friends and
acquaintances.</p>
<p>Dr. Gordon Hake, whose residence at Bury St. Edmunds was
contemporary with Borrow&rsquo;s settling down at Oulton, writes
in his Memoirs: &ldquo;George Borrow was one of those whose
mental powers are strong, and whose bodily frame is yet
stronger&mdash;a conjunction of forces often detrimental to a
literary career in an age of intellectual predominance.&nbsp; His
temper was good and bad; his pride was humility; his humility was
pride; his vanity, in being negative, was of the most positive
kind.&nbsp; He was reticent and candid, measured in speech, with
an emphasis that makes trifles significant.&nbsp; Borrow was
essentially hypochondriacal.&nbsp; Society he loved and hated
alike; he loved it that he might be pointed out and talked of; he
hated it because he was not the prince that he felt himself in
its midst.&nbsp; His figure was tall, and his bearing noble; he
had a finely moulded head and thick white hair&mdash;white from
his youth; his brown eyes were soft, yet piercing; his nose
somewhat of the Semitic type, which gave his face <!-- page
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the
cast of the young Memnon; his mouth had a generous curve, and his
features, for beauty and true power, were such as can have no
parallel in our portrait gallery, where it is to be hoped the
likeness of him, in Mr. Murray&rsquo;s possession, may one day
find a place.&nbsp; Borrow and his family used to stay with me at
Bury; I visited him, less often, at his cottage on the lake at
Oulton, a fine sheet of water that flows into the sea at
Lowestoft.&nbsp; He was much courted there by his neighbours and
by visitors to the seaside.&nbsp; I there met Baron Alderson and
his daughters, who had ridden from Lowestoft to see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had many good qualities, but it must be admitted that
his temper was queer and uncertain.&nbsp; At times he was
passionate and overbearing, and he never had the necessary
patience to submit to what seemed to him the inanities and
boredom of admirers, hero worshippers, and others who were
desirous of being brought to his notice.&nbsp; Mr. J. W. Donne,
who occupied the position of librarian of the London Library and
was afterwards reader of plays, related to Dr. Hake how on one
occasion Miss Agnes Strickland urged him to introduce her to her
brother author.&nbsp; Borrow, who was in the room at the time,
offered some objection, but was at length prevailed upon to
accept the introduction.&nbsp; Ignorant of the peculiar twists in
Borrow&rsquo;s nature, the gifted authoress commenced the
conversation by an enthusiastic eulogy of his works, and
concluded <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>by asking permission to send him a
copy of her &ldquo;Queens of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t, madam,&rdquo; exclaimed
Borrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should not know what to do with
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then got up in a rage, and, addressing Mr.
Donne, said, &ldquo;What a d--- fool that woman is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He once,&rdquo; writes Dr. Hake, &ldquo;went with me to
a dinner at Mr. Bevan&rsquo;s country-house, Rougham Rookery, and
placed me in an extremely awkward position.&nbsp; Mr. Bevan was a
Suffolk banker, a partner of Mr. Oakes.&nbsp; He was one of the
kindest and most benevolent of men.&nbsp; His wife was gentle,
unassuming, attentive to her guests.&nbsp; A friend of Borrow,
the heir to a very considerable estate, had run himself into
difficulties and owed money, which was not forthcoming, to the
Bury banking-house; and in order to secure repayment Mr. Bevan
was said to have &lsquo;struck the docket.&rsquo;&nbsp; I knew
this beforehand from Borrow, who, however, accepted the
invitation, and was seated at dinner at Mrs. Bevan&rsquo;s
side.&nbsp; This lady, a simple, unpretending woman, desirous of
pleasing him, said, &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Borrow, I have read your books
with so much pleasure!&rsquo;&nbsp; On which he exclaimed,
&lsquo;Pray, what books do you mean, madam?&nbsp; Do you mean my
account-books?&rsquo;&nbsp; On this he fretted and fumed, rose
from the table, and walked up and down amongst the servants
during the whole of dinner, and afterwards wandered about the
rooms and passage, till the carriage could be ordered for our
return home.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>On another occasion Hake and Borrow were guests together
at Hardwicke House, Suffolk, a fine old Jacobean Hall, then the
residence of Sir Thomas Cullum.&nbsp; There were also staying at
the Hall at the time Lord Bristol, Sir Fitzroy Kelly, William
Makepeace Thackeray, and other distinguished people.&nbsp; Borrow
and Thackeray did not get on well together.&nbsp; The latter
evidently felt it his duty to live up to his reputation by
entertaining the company with lively sallies and
witticisms.&nbsp; At last he approached Borrow, and inquired,
&ldquo;Have you read my Snob Papers in <i>Punch</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;In <i>Punch</i>?&rdquo; asked Borrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a
periodical I never look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. John Murray, in his &ldquo;Reminiscences,&rdquo; has also
given instances of Borrow&rsquo;s strange behaviour in other
people&rsquo;s houses; but there is reason to believe that he
often keenly reproached himself afterwards for giving way in
public to such unseemly displays of temper and spleen.&nbsp; That
his heart was in the right place and he was not lacking in powers
of restraint, are facts fully demonstrated by the following
incident.&nbsp; He was invited to meet Dr. Robert Latham at the
house of Dr. Hake, who had many inward tremors at what might be
the outcome of bringing them together.&nbsp; Latham was in the
habit of indulging somewhat too freely at table, and under such
circumstances, as might be expected, was often deficient in tact
and courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All, like most things that are planned, began
well.&nbsp; But with Latham life was a game of show.&nbsp; <!--
page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>He had to put forth all his knowledge of subjects in
which he deemed Borrow was an adept.&nbsp; He began with
horse-racing.&nbsp; Borrow quietly assented.&nbsp; He showed off
all he knew of the ring.&nbsp; Borrow freely responded.&nbsp; He
had to show what he knew of publishers, instancing the
Longmans.&nbsp; Borrow said, &lsquo;I suppose you dine with your
publishers sometimes?&rsquo;&nbsp; It was Latham&rsquo;s
opportunity; he could not resist it, and replied, &lsquo;Never; I
hope I should never do anything so low.&nbsp; You do not dine
with Mr. John Murray, I presume?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed, I
do,&rsquo; said Borrow, emotionally.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is a most
kind friend.&nbsp; When I have had sickness in my house he has
been unfailing in his goodness towards me.&nbsp; There is no man
I value more.&rsquo;&nbsp; Latham&rsquo;s conversation was fast
falling under the influence of wine; with this his better taste
departed from him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have heard,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;that you are a brave man over a bottle of wine.&nbsp; Now,
how many bottles can you get through at a sitting?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Borrow saw what the other was; he was resolved not to take
offence at what was only impertinent and self-asserting, so he
said, &lsquo;When I was in Madrid I knew a priest who would sit
down alone to his two bottles.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
replied Latham, with his knowing look and his head on one side
like a bird, &lsquo;but what I want to know is, how many bottles
you can manage at one sitting?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I once knew
another priest,&rsquo; said Borrow, &lsquo;it was at Oporto; I
have seen him get through two bottles by himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; By
this time Latham was a little unsteady, he slipped <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>from
his chair as if it had been an inclined plane and lay on the
carpet.&nbsp; He was unable to rise, but he held his head up with
a cunning smile, saying, &lsquo;This must be a very disreputable
house.&rsquo;&nbsp; Borrow saw Latham after this at times on his
way to me, and always stopped to say a kind word to him, seeing
his forlorn condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given as he was to snubbing and browbeating others, Borrow was
not a man to sit silent and see another man badly treated without
raising hand or voice in his defence.&nbsp; Proof of this is
found in an instructive story related by Mr. J. Ewing Ritchie in
his chatty &ldquo;East Anglian Reminiscences.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;One good anecdote I heard about George Borrow,&rdquo;
writes Mr. Ritchie.&nbsp; &ldquo;My informant was an Independent
minister, at the time supplying the pulpit at Lowestoft and
staying at Oulton Hall, then inhabited by a worthy dissenting
tenant.&nbsp; One night a meeting of the Bible Society was held
at Mutford Bridge, at which the party from the Hall attended, and
where George Borrow was one of the speakers.&nbsp; After the
meeting was over, all the speakers went back to supper at Oulton
Hall, and my friend among them, who, in the course of the supper,
found himself violently attacked by a clergyman for holding
Calvinistic opinions.&nbsp; Naturally my friend replied that the
clergyman was bound to do the same.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you make
that out?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, the Articles of your Church
are Calvinistic, and to them you have sworn assent!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh yes, but there <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>is a way of
explaining them away!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How so?&rsquo; said my
friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; replied the clergyman, &lsquo;we
are not bound to take the words in their natural
sense.&rsquo;&nbsp; My friend, an honest, blunt East Anglian,
intimated that he did not understand that way of evading the
difficulty; but he was then a young man and did not like to
continue the discussion further.&nbsp; However, George Borrow,
who had not said a word hitherto, entered into the discussion,
opening fire on the clergyman in a very unexpected manner, and
giving him such a setting down as the hearers, at any rate, never
forgot.&nbsp; All the sophistry about the non-natural meaning of
terms was held up by Borrow to ridicule, and the clergyman was
beaten at every point.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; says my friend,
&lsquo;did I hear one man give another such a dressing as on that
occasion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Borrow was often asked by visitors to Oulton if it was his
intention to leave behind him the necessary material for the
compilation of a biography of his strange career.&nbsp; This,
however, he could never be persuaded to do.&nbsp; He maintained
that &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; contained all of his life that
it was necessary for posterity to know.&nbsp; It was not the man
but his works that should live, he would say, and his books
contained the best part of himself.&nbsp; While in London,
however, at the house which he took in Hereford Square, Brompton,
he consented to sit for his <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>portrait, the
artist being Henry Philips.&nbsp; This picture afterwards passed
into the possession of his step-daughter, Mrs. Henrietta
MacOubrey.</p>
<p>Of the painting of this portrait a very good story is
told.&nbsp; Borrow was a very bad sitter, he was ever anxious to
get out into the fresh air and sunlight.&nbsp; Philips was
greatly hindered by this restlessness, but one day he hit upon a
plan which conquered the chafing child of Nature and served his
own purpose admirably.&nbsp; He was aware of Borrow&rsquo;s
wonderful gift of tongues and the fascination that philological
studies had for him.&nbsp; So he remarked, &ldquo;I have always
heard, Mr. Borrow, that the Persian is a very fine language; is
it so?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is, Philips; it is,&rdquo; replied
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you will not mind
reciting me something in the Persian tongue?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear me, no; certainly not.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
Borrow&rsquo;s face lit up with the light that Philips longed
for, and he commenced declaiming at the top of his voice, while
the painter made the most of his opportunity.&nbsp; When he found
his subject was lapsing into silence, and that the old feeling of
weariness and boredom was again creeping upon him, he would start
him off again by saying, &ldquo;I have always heard that the
Turkish&mdash;or the Armenian&mdash;is a very fine
language,&rdquo; with a like result, until at length the portrait
was completed.</p>
<p>The monotony of Borrow&rsquo;s life at Oulton was varied by
occasional visits to London and excursions into Wales and to the
Isle of Man.&nbsp; In his travels <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>through Wales
he was accompanied by his wife and step-daughter.&nbsp; How the
journey was brought about he explains in the first chapter of
&ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; a work which, published in 1862, was
the outcome of his ramblings in the Principality.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
the summer of 1854, myself, wife and daughter, determined upon
going into Wales, to pass a few months there.&nbsp; We are
country-people of a corner of East Anglia, and, at the time of
which I am speaking, had been residing so long on our own little
estate that we had become tired of the objects around us, and
conceived that we should be all the better for changing the scene
for a short period.&nbsp; We were undetermined for some time with
respect to where we should go.&nbsp; I proposed Wales from the
first, but my wife and daughter, who have always had rather a
hankering after what is fashionable, said they thought it would
be more advisable to go to Harrogate or Leamington.&nbsp; On my
observing that these were terrible places for expense, they
replied that though the price of corn had of late been shamefully
low we had a spare hundred pounds or two in our pockets and could
afford to pay for a little insight into fashionable life.&nbsp; I
told them that there was nothing I so much hated as fashionable
life, but that, as I was anything but a selfish person, I would
endeavour to stifle my abhorrence of it for a time and attend
them either to Leamington or Harrogate.&nbsp; By this speech I
obtained my wish, even as I knew I should, for my wife and
daughter instantly observed that, after all, they thought we <!--
page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>had better go into Wales, which, though not so
fashionable as either Leamington or Harrogate, was a very
picturesque country, where they had no doubt they should get on
very well, more especially as I was acquainted with the Welsh
language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is Borrow&rsquo;s account of how he obtained his own way;
it would have been interesting had his wife and step-daughter
also recorded their version of the affair.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s mother, who had given up her house in Willow
Lane, died at Oulton, in 1860.&nbsp; The same year Borrow
published a small volume, entitled &ldquo;The Sleeping
Bard,&rdquo; a translation from the Welsh of Elis Wyn.&nbsp;
During the years 1862&ndash;3 various translations of his
appeared in <i>Once a Week</i>, a magazine that then numbered
amongst its contributors such writers as Harriet Martineau and S.
Baring-Gould, and artists as Leech, Keene, Tenniel, Millais and
Du Maurier.&nbsp; Amongst these translations were &ldquo;The
Hailstorm, or the Death of Bui,&rdquo; from the ancient Norse;
&ldquo;The Count of Vendal&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; from the
ancient Danish; &ldquo;Harald Harfagr,&rdquo; from the Norse;
&ldquo;Emelian the Fool,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Story of Yashka
with the Bear&rsquo;s Ear,&rdquo; from the Russian; and several
ballads from the Manx.&nbsp; Other translations from the Danish
of Oehlenschlaeger are still in the possession of Mrs. MacOubrey,
and have never been printed.&nbsp; His last book, &ldquo;The
Romano Lavo-Lil,&rdquo; was issued in 1872.</p>
<p>Between 1860 and 1870, Borrow spent a good <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>deal of his
time in London, at his house in Hereford Square.&nbsp; This was
mainly on account of the ill-health of his wife, who died there
in 1869, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.&nbsp; After her
death, however, he returned to Oulton, telling Mr. Watts that he
was going down into East Anglia to die.</p>
<p>From that time his life was lived more apart from the world
than ever.&nbsp; His visitors were few; and fewer still were the
visits he paid to others.&nbsp; During his latter years his tall,
erect, somewhat mysterious figure was often seen in the early
hours of summer mornings or late at night on the lonely pathways
that wind in and out from the banks of Oulton Broad.&nbsp; He
loved to be mysterious, and the village children used to hush
their voices and draw aside at his approach.&nbsp; They looked
upon him with fear and awe&mdash;for had they not seen him stop
and talk with the gipsies, who ran away with little
children?&nbsp; But in his heart, Borrow was fond of the little
ones, though it amused him to watch the impression his strange
personality made upon them.&nbsp; Older people he seldom spoke to
when out on his solitary rambles; but sometimes he would flash
out such a glance from beneath his broad-brimmed hat and shaggy
eyebrows as would make timid country-folk hasten on their way
filled with vague thoughts and fears of the evil eye.&nbsp; Mr.
John Murray has referred to this love of mystery on the part of
his father&rsquo;s friend, and also to his moody and variable
temperament; while Mr. G. T. Bettany has related how he enjoyed
<!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>creating a sensation by riding about on a fine Arab
horse which he brought home with him from Turkey in 1844.</p>
<p>Still Borrow was not unpopular with the villagers, many of
whom, long after his death, remembered little acts of kindness on
his part by which they had benefited.&nbsp; To the sick and
infirm he was always a good friend, though his almost invariable
remedy for all the ills that flesh is heir to were wine and
ale.&nbsp; He was exceedingly fond of animals, and nothing
aroused his wrath more than to see them badly treated.&nbsp; On
one occasion, while out walking not far from his home, he
encountered some men who were ill-using a fallen horse.&nbsp; He
remonstrated with them, and his words, backed by his commanding
figure, prevailed upon them to desist from their cruelty.&nbsp;
He then sent one of them for a bowl of ale.&nbsp; When it was
brought, he knelt down on the road beside the exhausted animal,
and poured it down its throat.&nbsp; Having afterwards assisted
the men in getting the horse upon its feet, he left them, but not
before he had given them a severe lecture on the treatment of
dumb animals in general and fallen horses in particular.</p>
<p>At another time, a favourite old cat that was ill, crawled out
of his house to die in the garden hedge.&nbsp; Borrow no sooner
missed the poor creature than he went in search of it, and
brought it indoors in his arms.&nbsp; He then laid it down in a
comfortable spot, and sat and watched it till it was dead.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Owing to the somewhat eccentric manner in which he
passed his latter days, there were some persons who assumed after
his death that in his declining years he lacked the attention of
friends, and the little comforts and considerations that are due
to old age.&nbsp; Yet this was not so; if the world heard little
of him from the time of his final retirement into rural
seclusion, and lost sight of him and believed him dead, it was
his own choosing that they should remain in ignorance.&nbsp; He
had had his day, a longer and fuller one than falls to the lot of
most of the sons of men, and, when the weight of years began to
tell upon him, he chose to live out the little time that was left
to him amidst such scenes as were in harmony with his
nature.&nbsp; He died at Oulton on July 26, 1881, just three
weeks after the completion of his seventy-eighth year.&nbsp; His
step-daughter, Mrs. MacOubrey, the Henrietta of &ldquo;Wild
Wales,&rdquo; who had a sincere affection for him, was his
constant attendant during his last illness, and was with him at
the end.&nbsp; He was buried at Brompton Cemetery, where his body
lies beside that of his wife.&nbsp; Not long after his death, his
Oulton home was pulled down.&nbsp; All that now remains to mark
the spot where it once stood are the old summer-house in which he

60</span>CHAPTER VI: BORROW AND PUGILISM</h2>
<p>During the first quarter of the present century pugilism was
rampant in the Eastern Counties of England.&nbsp; A pugilistic
encounter was then looked upon as an affair of national interest,
and people came in their thousands from far and near to witness
it.&nbsp; The Norwich neighbourhood was noted for its
prize-fights, and Borrow had the names of all the champions at
his tongue&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Cobbett, Cribb, Belcher, Tom Spring
of Bedford, Black Richmond, Irish Randall&mdash;he was acquainted
with the records of them all, as well as with those of the
leading fighting-men amongst the gipsies.&nbsp; They were to him
the leaders of the old spirit of English aggressiveness, and as
such he revered them.&nbsp; His pen was always ready to defend a
straightforward bruiser, with whom, he contended, the Roman
gladiator and the Spanish bull-fighter were not to be
compared.&nbsp; He, himself, was no mean student of the art of
self-defence, and there is some ground for believing that the
scene between Lavengro and the Flaming Tinman, in which the burly
tinker succumbs to the <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>former&rsquo;s prowess after a warm
encounter in the Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle, is founded upon an event
which occurred during Borrow&rsquo;s wayward progress through
rural England.</p>
<p>On the publication of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; Borrow&rsquo;s
evident partiality for the pugilists of his day brought down upon
him a torrent of criticism and condemnation.&nbsp; Who, it was
asked, but a man of coarse instincts could have found pleasure in
mingling with brutal fighting-men and describing their desperate
exploits?&nbsp; The writer of a work who went out of his way to
drag in such characters and scenes as these could be little
better than a barbarian!</p>
<p>Borrow was not a man to sit down quietly under such attacks as
these; he waited his opportunity, and then had his fling.&nbsp;
At the end of &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; there appeared an
Appendix, in which the author set himself the task of smashing
his critics.&nbsp; This same Appendix is an amazing piece of
writing; in it Borrow slashes right and left as might a gallant
swordsman who found himself alone in the midst of a mob bent on
his destruction.&nbsp; Mr. Augustine Birrell regrets that it was
ever printed; but there are few who will agree with him; it
contains too many good things that Borrovians would be loth to
lose.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s defence is carried on in his own peculiar and
inimitable style, it is an onslaught into the camp of the
enemy.&nbsp; Speaking of the prize-fighters, whom a reviewer
condemned as blackguards, he exclaims <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>defiantly,
&ldquo;Can the rolls of the English aristocracy exhibit names
belonging to more noble, more heroic men than those who were
called respectively Pearce, Cribb, and Spring?&nbsp; Did ever one
of the English aristocracy contract the seeds of fatal
consumption by rushing up the stairs of a burning edifice, even
to the topmost garret, and rescuing a woman from seemingly
inevitable destruction?&nbsp; The writer says no.&nbsp; A woman
was rescued from the top of a burning house; but the man who
rescued her was no aristocrat; it was Pearce, not Percy, who ran
up the burning stairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he goes on,
overwhelming his opponents with a tornado of generalities that
have nothing whatever to do with prize-fighting, and yet how
delightful it all is!</p>
<p>There were other critics&mdash;Borrow always had plenty of
critics&mdash;who found it difficult to make his admiration for
the prize-ring fit in with his denunciation in one passage of
&ldquo;those disgraceful and brutalising exhibitions called
pugilistic combats.&rdquo;&nbsp; The explanation has been
suggested that for once the &ldquo;John Bull&rdquo; Borrow, with
his patriotic exaltation of all things English, gave way before
the proselytising agent of the British and Foreign Bible
Society.&nbsp; It would be hard to find a writer who does not
contradict himself at times, and Borrow was so much a man of
&ldquo;moods&rdquo; that it would be uncharitable to set him down
as a hypocrite, as Caroline Fox does, because all his sayings and
doings do not tally with a superhuman exactitude.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>But whether it was in respect to the number of glasses
of ale that he drank on his Welsh rambles&mdash;and has not
&ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; been called &ldquo;The Epic of
Ale?&rdquo;&mdash;or his associations with the great fighting-men
of his day, he was never ashamed to admit his liking both for the
ale and the men.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I hide the truth?&rdquo;
he asks, when telling of his presence when a boy of fourteen at a
prize-fight which took place near Norwich.&nbsp; Thurtell, whose
boast it was that he had introduced bruising into East Anglia,
had arranged the fight, which was ever after memorable to Borrow
for the appearance on the scene of Gipsy Will and his celebrated
gang.&nbsp; This well-known Romany, who was afterwards hanged
outside the gaol at Bury St. Edmunds for a murder committed in
his youth, was a sturdy, muscular fellow, six feet in height, who
rendered himself especially noticeable by wearing a
broad-brimmed, high-peaked Andalusian hat.&nbsp; He was anxious
on this occasion to fight the best man in England for twenty
pounds (not a very tempting sum in the light of our more advanced
days); but no one accepted the challenge, though a young
countryman was anxious to do so until assured by his friends that
the notorious gipsy would certainly kill him.</p>
<p>Borrow has gone out of his way in &ldquo;The Gipsies of
Spain&rdquo; to give a full description of this Gipsy Will and
his notable companions.&nbsp; At the risk of wearying some
readers who deprecate the prize-ring <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>and its
cosmopolitan environment, the writer quotes something of this
description, as it appears in one of the less known of
Borrow&rsquo;s works:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time before the commencement of the combat, three
men, mounted on wild-looking horses came dashing down the road in
the direction of the meadow, in the midst of which they presently
showed themselves, their horses clearing the deep ditches with
wonderful alacrity.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Gipsy Will and his
gang,&rsquo; lisped a Hebrew pickpocket; &lsquo;we shall have
another fight.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word gipsy was always sufficient
to excite my curiosity, and I looked attentively at the
new-comers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen gipsies of various lands, Russian,
Hungarian, and Turkish; and I have also seen the legitimate
children of most countries of the world; but I never saw, upon
the whole, three more remarkable individuals, as far as personal
appearance was concerned, than the three English gipsies who now
presented themselves to my eyes on that spot.&nbsp; Two of them
had dismounted, and were holding their horses by the reins.&nbsp;
The tallest, and, at the first glance, the most (!) interesting
of the two, was almost a giant, for his height could not have
been less than six feet three.&nbsp; It is impossible for the
imagination to conceive anything more perfectly beautiful than
were the features of this man, and the most skilful sculptor of
Greece might have taken them as his model for a hero and a
god.&nbsp; The forehead was exceedingly lofty, a rare thing in a
gipsy; the nose <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>less Roman than Grecian, fine, yet
delicate; the eyes large, overhung with long drooping lashes,
giving them almost a melancholy expression; it was only when the
lashes were elevated that the gipsy glance was seen, if that can
be called a glance which is a strange stare, like nothing else in
the world.&nbsp; His complexion was a beautiful olive; and his
teeth were of a brilliancy uncommon even among these people, who
have all fine teeth.&nbsp; He was dressed in a coarse
waggoner&rsquo;s slop, which, however, was unable to conceal
altogether the proportions of his noble and Herculean
figure.&nbsp; He might be about twenty-eight.&nbsp; His companion
and his captain, Gipsy Will, was, I think, fifty, when he was
hanged ten years subsequently.&nbsp; I have still present before
me his bushy black hair, his black face, and his big black eyes,
fixed and staring.&nbsp; His dress consisted of a loose blue
jockey coat, jockey boots and breeches; in his hand was a huge
jockey whip, and on his head (it struck me at the time for its
singularity) a broad-brimmed, high-peaked, Andalusian hat, or at
least one very much resembling those generally worn in that
province.&nbsp; In stature he was shorter than his more youthful
companion, yet he must have measured six feet at least, and was
stronger built, if possible.&nbsp; What brawn! what bone! what
legs! what thighs!&nbsp; The third gipsy, who remained on
horseback, looked more like a phantom than anything human.&nbsp;
His complexion was the colour of pale dust, and of that same
colour was all that pertained to him, hat and <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>clothes.&nbsp; His boots were dusty, of course, and his
very horse was of a dusty dun.&nbsp; His features were
whimsically ugly, most of his teeth were gone, and as to his age,
he might be thirty or sixty.&nbsp; He was somewhat lame and halt;
but an unequalled rider when once upon his steed, which he was
naturally not very solicitous to quit.&nbsp; I subsequently
discovered that he was considered the wizard of the
gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any one who is familiar with the living descendants of the
Romanies of Borrow&rsquo;s early lifetime will know that amongst
the few characteristics of their fathers that have been preserved
down to the present day is that skill at boxing or fisticuffs
which was an absolute necessity in a time when their hand was
against every man and every man&rsquo;s hand against them.&nbsp;
Nearly all the male Romanies are possessed of a lithe, sinewy,
active frame, combined with a quickness of hand and eye that
gives them a considerable advantage over less alert antagonists
of heavier build.&nbsp; They are not, as a rule, in a hurry to
come to blows, for they know that in the event of injury or
police-court proceedings resulting from an encounter, prejudice
is strongly against the gipsy.&nbsp; Still, the Romany blood
pulses quickly, and when it flies to the swarthy cheek and sets
the eyes flashing, the time has come for someone to beware.&nbsp;
The writer has seen something of the gipsy&rsquo;s skill and
adroitness under such conditions, and the impression made was a
lasting one.&nbsp; He has known, too, of a small, slim-built
Romany thrashing a strong, six-feet-high <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>constable,
for unwarrantable interference with the former&rsquo;s mother in
a public bar.&nbsp; The Romany race is fast dying out from our
midst; but it is dying what the sportsman would call
&ldquo;game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Borrow&rsquo;s obvious admiration for the brawny men
of the prize-ring brought him almost universal condemnation, his
opinions were unchanged by his critics&rsquo; wrath and
denunciations.&nbsp; There were many points in his father&rsquo;s
character for which he held him in esteem and affection; but he
admired him most because he had once vanquished Big Ben Brain in
a fight in Hyde Park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always at his best,&rdquo; writes Mr. Theodore
Watts, &ldquo;in describing a pugilistic encounter; for in the
saving grace of pugilism as an English accomplishment, he
believed as devoutly as he believed in East Anglia and the
Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>CHAPTER VII: BORROW AND THE EAST ANGLIAN GIPSIES</h2>
<p>East Anglia has for centuries been a favourite roaming ground
for certain of the families of the true Romany tribe.&nbsp; The
reason for this, assigned by the gipsies themselves, is not a
flattering one to East Englanders.&nbsp; They will tell you, if
you are in their confidence, that they come to East Anglia on
account of the simplicity and gullibility of its
inhabitants.&nbsp; Nowhere else can the swarthy <i>chals</i> find
<i>gorgios</i> so ready to purchase a doctored nag, or the
dark-eyed <i>chis</i> so easily cozen credulous villagers and
simple servant-girls by the mysteries of <i>dukkeripen</i>.&nbsp;
Every fair-ground and race-course is dotted with their travelling
vans; the end of every harvest sees them congregate on the
village greens; the &ldquo;making up&rdquo; of the North Sea
fishing-boats attracts them to the Eastern coast.</p>
<p>It may well be that Borrow first made the acquaintance of the
Romanies when a child at East Dereham, for there is a heath just
outside the little town which has long been their central
halting-place for the district.&nbsp; If this was the case, he
has left no <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>record of such a meeting: in all
probability, had his wondering eyes rested upon their unfamiliar
faces and smouldering camp-fires he would have shared the
childish fears instilled by kitchen and nursery legends and have
fled the scene.&nbsp; It was outside Norman Cross that he first
came into close contact with the alien wanderers.&nbsp; Straying
into a green lane he fell in with a low tent from which smoke was
issuing, and in front of which a man was carding plaited straw,
while a woman was engaged in the manufacture of spurious
coin.&nbsp; Their queer appearance, so unlike that of any men or
women he had hitherto encountered, excited his lively curiosity;
but, ere he had time to examine them closely, they were down upon
him with threats and curses.&nbsp; Violence was about to be done
to him when a viper, which he had concealed in his jacket, lifted
its head from his bosom, and the gipsies&rsquo; wrath at being
discovered changed to awe of one who fearlessly handled such a
deadly creature.&nbsp; From that day Borrow&rsquo;s interest in
the Romany tribe continued to widen and deepen, until, at length,
when fame and fortune were his, it led him to take extended
journeys into Hungary, Wallachia, and other European countries
for the purpose of searching out the descendants of the original
wanderers from the East and learning from them their language,
customs and history.</p>
<p>Borrow himself says that he could remember no time when the
mere mention of the name of gipsy <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>did not
awaken within him feelings hard to be described.&nbsp; He could
not account for it, but some of the Romanies, he remarks,
&ldquo;to whom I have stated this circumstance have accounted for
it on the supposition that the soul which at present animates my
body has at some former period tenanted that of one of their
people, for many among them are believers in metempsychosis and,
like the followers of Bouddha, imagine that their souls by
passing through an infinite number of bodies, attain at length
sufficient purity to be admitted to a state of perfect rest and
quietude, which is the only idea of heaven they can
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Norwich Castle Hill provided Borrow with many
opportunities of observing the habits of the East Anglian
Romanies, who, in his day, attended in considerable numbers the
horse sales and fairs that were held in the old city.&nbsp;
Thither would come the Smiths or Petulengros, Bosviles, Grays and
Pinfolds; and often, when they left the Hill, he would accompany
them to their camps on Mousehold Heath and to neighbouring fairs
and markets.&nbsp; Their daring horsemanship fascinated him,
while the strange tongue they employed amongst themselves when
bargaining with the farmers and dealers, aroused in him a
curiosity that could only be satisfied by a closer acquaintance
with its form and meaning.&nbsp; Many of the <i>chals</i> and
<i>chis</i> to be met with in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; were transferred to the pages of
those works from the East <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Anglian
heaths and fairsteads.&nbsp; It was on a heath not far from his
Suffolk home that he introduced the Jew of Fez to Jasper
Petulengro in order that he might refute the theory entertained
by one of his critics that the Romanies were nothing less than
the descendants of the two lost tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>The village of Oulton, too, gave him many chances of
intercourse with the gipsies.&nbsp; Within five minutes&rsquo;
walk of his home there is a spot where they frequently assembled,
and where a few of them may sometimes be seen even at the present
day.&nbsp; The writer has reason to know that the gipsies looked
upon Borrow with no small amount of curiosity, for they were
unaccustomed to meet with <i>gorgios</i> of his position who took
so keen an interest in their sayings and doings.&nbsp; As a rule,
they are exceedingly suspicious of the approaches of any one
outside the Romany pale; and it must not be assumed that he was
popular with them because he usually succeeded in extracting from
them the information he required.&nbsp; There was something about
Borrow that made it hard to evade his questioning; he had such a
masterful way with him, and his keen eyes fixed upon a man as
though they would pierce him through and read his most secret
thoughts.&nbsp; He himself attributes his success with the
gipsies to his knowledge of the Romany tongue and customs, while
they firmly believed that he had gipsy blood in his veins.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has known them,&rdquo; he says, <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>writing of
himself as the author of &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; &ldquo;for
upwards of twenty years in various countries, and they never
injured a hair of his head or deprived him of a shred of his
raiment; but he is not deceived as to the motive of their
forbearance: they thought him a <i>Rom</i>, and on this
supposition they hurt him not, their love of &lsquo;the
blood&rsquo; being their most distinguishing
characteristic.&rdquo;&nbsp; This error on their part served his
purpose well, as it enabled him to obtain from them a great deal
of curious knowledge that would never have come into his
possession had it been known he was one of the despised
<i>gorgios</i>.&nbsp; He was known amongst them as the Romany
Rye; but that is a name by which, even at the present day, they
distinguished any stranger who can &ldquo;rokkra Romany&rdquo; to
the extent of a dozen words.</p>
<p>Although Borrow spent so much time amongst the East Anglian
gipsies, it is often difficult to ascertain the exact localities
in which he met with them.&nbsp; He seldom condescends to give
the date of any incident, and as infrequently does he choose to
enlighten us as to his precise whereabouts when it
occurred.&nbsp; Then, too, one might conclude that his
investigations were almost wholly confined to two families, those
of the Smiths or Petulengros, and Hernes.&nbsp; As Mr. Watts has
aptly remarked, one would imagine from all that is said about
these families in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany
Rye&rdquo; <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>that he knew nothing about the other
Romanies of the Eastern Counties.&nbsp; Yet he must have been
familiar also with the Bosviles, Grays, and Pinfolds, some
descendants of whom still haunt the heaths and greens of Eastern
England.&nbsp; According to Borrow, the Petulengros were
continually turning up wherever he might wander.&nbsp; Jasper
Petulengro&rsquo;s nature seems something akin to that of the
Wandering Jew; and yet, if we may believe &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
and our own knowledge, the Smiths look upon East Anglia as their
native heath.&nbsp; First, he appears in the green lane near
Norman Cross; then at Norwich Fair and on Mousehold Heath; again
at Greenwich Fair, where he tries to persuade Lavengro to take to
the gipsy life; and once more in the neighbourhood of the noted
dingle of the Isopel Berners episode.&nbsp; This, of course, is
due to the exigencies of what Mr. Watts calls a &ldquo;spiritual
biography,&rdquo; and it is evident that whenever anything
particularly striking pertaining to the Romanies occurs to Borrow
the Romanies themselves promptly appear to illustrate it.</p>
<p>Yet we know that Jasper Petulengro was a genuine character,
even if he comes to us under a fictitious name.&nbsp; He was a
representative of one of the oldest of the East Anglian gipsy
families, and a personal friend of Borrow, who found in him much
that was in common with his own nature.&nbsp; Borrow has left a
dependable record of a meeting which took <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>place between
them at his Oulton home, during the Christmas of 1842.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He stayed with me during the greater part of the morning,
discoursing on the affairs of Egypt, the aspect of which, he
assured me, was becoming daily worse and worse.&nbsp; There is no
living for the poor people, brother, said he, the chokengres
(police) pursue us from place to place, and the gorgios are
become either so poor or miserly, that they grudge our cattle a
bite of grass by the wayside, and ourselves a yard of ground to
light a fire upon.&nbsp; Unless times alter, brother, and of that
I see no probability, unless you are made either poknees or
mecralliskoe geiro (Justice of the Peace or Prime Minister), I am
afraid the poor persons will have to give up wandering
altogether, and then what will become of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet there was much of Borrow&rsquo;s nature that was in common
with that of Jasper Petulengro.&nbsp; Often the swarthy,
horse-dealing gipsy was the mouthpiece through which he breathed
forth his own abhorrence of conventional restraints and the
thronging crowds of busy streets.&nbsp; He loved the open air
country life that he lived near the Suffolk coast, where the
fresh salt winds sweep up from the sea across gorse-clad denes
and pleasant pasture-lands.&nbsp; He was happiest when amongst
the &ldquo;summer saturated heathen&rdquo; of the heath and
glen.&nbsp; Who can doubt that the much-quoted conversation in
the twenty-fifth chapter of <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; gives expression to much of
Borrow&rsquo;s own philosophy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is sweet, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s night and day, brother,
both sweet things; sun, moon and stars, brother, all sweet
things; there&rsquo;s likewise a wind on the heath.&nbsp; Life is
very sweet, brother; who would wish to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would wish to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like a gorgio&mdash;which is the same as
talking like a fool&mdash;were you a Romany chal you would talk
wiser.&nbsp; Wish to die, indeed!&nbsp; A Romany chal would wish
to live for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sickness, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the sun and stars, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In blindness, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the wind on the heath, brother; if I
could only feel that, I would gladly live for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like Bamfylde Moore Carew, though for a different reason, it
was to the gipsy life that Borrow turned after his unsuccessful
literary work in London.&nbsp; Disappointed and despondent, he
fled the scenes that had witnessed his failures.&nbsp; It is easy
to imagine how great must have been his sense of freedom when he
cast off the shackles of city life, and breathed again the air of
the hills and pine-woods of rural England.&nbsp; With the poet
whose <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>bones rest in the midst of the little
town of his birth, he felt and all his life maintained, that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis liberty alone that gives the
flower<br />
Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume,<br />
And we are weeds without it.&nbsp; All constraint,<br />
Except what wisdom lays on evil men,<br />
Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes<br />
Their progress in the road of science; blinds<br />
The eyesight of discovery, and begets<br />
In those that suffer it, a sordid mind<br />
Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit<br />
To be the tenant of man&rsquo;s noble form.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gipsies of the first quarter of the present century
possessed the distinctive characteristics of their type in a far
more marked degree than their descendants of to-day.&nbsp; There
were few amongst them who had not a fair knowledge of the old
Romany tongue, though they were utterly ignorant of its
source.&nbsp; Questioned as to where their ancestors came from,
they would tell you Egypt; and &ldquo;business of Egypt&rdquo;
was their name for the mysteries of fortune-telling, and the
other questionable proceedings they engaged in.&nbsp; Several of
their families were fairly well-to-do in the eyes of their tribe,
though the fact was carefully concealed from inquisitive
gorgios.&nbsp; Often a gipsy <i>gry-engro</i>, or horse-dealer,
would have a score or more horses on his hands at a time, while,
not infrequently, his sales on a fair-day would amount to
&pound;50 or &pound;60.&nbsp; The women of his camp would be
gaudily and expensively <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>dressed, and bedecked in heavy gold
jewelry: he, himself, would often spend five or six pounds on a
suit of clothes, and half a guinea on a silk handkerchief for his
neck.&nbsp; Few of the women ever thought of marrying out of the
Romany tribe, and their virtue and constancy were an example to
all classes of society.</p>
<p>This last-mentioned fact is the more striking in view of the
intense admiration often felt for the handsome <i>chis</i> by men
who were not of the gipsy race.&nbsp; Commenting upon it not long
ago, <a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a> an <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> reviewer said:
&ldquo;Between some Englishmen and gipsy women there is an
extraordinary attraction&mdash;an attraction, we may say in
passing, which did not exist between Borrow and the gipsy women
with whom he was brought into contact.&nbsp; Supposing Borrow to
have been physically drawn to any woman, she would have been of
the Scandinavian type; she would have been what he used to call a
Brynhild.&nbsp; It was tall blondes he really admired.&nbsp;
Hence, notwithstanding his love of the economies of gipsy life,
his gipsy women are all mere scenic characters, they clothe and
beautify the scene: they are not dramatic characters.&nbsp; When
he comes to delineate a heroine, Isopel Bernes, she is physically
the very opposite of the Romany <i>chi</i>&mdash;a Scandinavian
Brynhild, in short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Watts has remarked on Borrow&rsquo;s neglect to <!-- page
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>portray the higher traits in the gipsy woman&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; Mrs. Herne and her grandchild Leonora, who are
instanced as the two great successes of his Romany group, are
both steeped in wickedness, and by omitting to draw a picture of
the women&rsquo;s loftier side, he is said to have failed to
demonstrate their great claim for distinction.&nbsp; There is a
good deal of truth in this accusation; and yet it cannot be
admitted wholly justifiable.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The Romany
Rye&rdquo; we have a whole chapter devoted to the emphasising of
the chastity of the Romany girls, and their self-sacrificing
devotion to their husbands.&nbsp; Ursula marries a lazy,
good-for-nothing <i>chal</i>, and then expressess her willingness
to steal and swindle in order to keep him in comfort.&nbsp; The
method is not commendable, but the object that prompts it is
highly praiseworthy&mdash;from a Romany point of view.</p>
<p>But to-day the old race of genuine Romanies is fast dying out,
and soon we shall have wholly lost the traces of a people who for
many centuries have constituted a familiar feature of English
country life.&nbsp; One of the last surviving <i>chals</i> of an
old East Anglian gipsy family, in reply to a remark of the writer
said, not long ago, &ldquo;Yes, it is quite true that the old
race of gipsies is dying out; there are very few of the real old
Romanies to be met with at the present day.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mumpers&rsquo; there are in plenty; folks who sell baskets
and peddle clothes-pegs; but they are not of the true gipsy
breed.&nbsp; At one time <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>a gipsy never
married out of his or her own tribe; but that day has gone, and
there has been reared a mixed race with little of the true blood
in them.&nbsp; Marrying into the &lsquo;mumping&rsquo; and
house-dwelling families has brought this about, and soon there
will be no true Romanies left.&nbsp; Here and there you may meet
a few, such as the Grays, Lees, and Coopers, and one or two of
the Pinfolds; but they, too, are going the way of the rest.&nbsp;
Yes, as you say, it is a pity, for after all the Romanies are a
strange people, and, bad as they may have been, they were not
without their good points.&nbsp; They knew a good horse when they
saw one, and they let people see how a man, if he chooses, can
shift for himself, without being beholden to any one.&nbsp;
Anyhow, they have given clever men something to puzzle their

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on my Romany friend, &ldquo;this old

have known some of them come to our tents and vans and write down
the words and their meaning as we told them.&nbsp; I did not mind
their doing it; but some of my people did not like it, and told
them lies, and put them off with all sorts of queer
stories.&nbsp; They were afraid the men should put the words into
their books, and then it might be <!-- page 80--><a

the gipsies when they wished to have a little talk amongst
themselves on matters that were nobody&rsquo;s business but their
own.&nbsp; Very few of the gipsies can read, so they did not
learn the language in that way; most of us who know anything of
it picked it up from our fathers and mothers when we were
young.&nbsp; My father used to teach me certain sayings about
horses that were very useful when we were dealing at the

more about these things than we do ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
